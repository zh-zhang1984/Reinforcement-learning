# reinforcement learning 
While most repository for coding reinforcement learning is based on Python (https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction), I want to write R code to study the examples in the Sutton's book. Hope it is a good journey to understanfd reinforcement learning.
